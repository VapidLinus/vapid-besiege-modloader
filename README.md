# Besiege Modloader
**This project has been abandoned. Spaar has continued my work over at the Besiege forum:**

This is a prototype for a modloader for Besiege. It is unfinished, buggy, and messy. 

Feel free to use my code as a reference for your own projects, but I would advise against using the code as is :)
